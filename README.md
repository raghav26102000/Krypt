Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain App

Krypt is a cutting-edge web application built with React.js that connects seamlessly to the blockchain using Solidity and Smart Contracts. This project exemplifies the integration of front-end technologies with blockchain development, enabling users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) directly from their web browsers.

Key Features:

Blockchain Integration:** Connects React.js front-end to the Ethereum blockchain.
Smart Contracts:** Implements Solidity smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions.
Decentralized Application (dApp):** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with blockchain functionalities.
Web 3.0 Technology:** Harnesses the power of Web 3.0 by leveraging blockchain capabilities within a web application.
Technologies Used:

React.js: Front-end development library for building user interfaces.
Solidity: Ethereum's smart contract programming language.
Ethereum Blockchain: Decentralized platform for executing smart contracts.
Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
Truffle Suite: Development framework for Ethereum DApps and smart contracts.
Metamask: Ethereum wallet extension used for interaction with blockchain applications.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Ensure you have Metamask or another Ethereum wallet installed in your browser.
Start the React.js application using npm start.
Connect Metamask to the appropriate Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten, or a local Ganache instance).
Interact with the decentralized features provided by the app.
